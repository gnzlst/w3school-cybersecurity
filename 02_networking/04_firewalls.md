# Firewalls

## Firewalls

- Firewalls are a central architectural element to any network. They are designed to keep out all network traffic, except traffic which we allow. Firewalls operate on Layer 4, typically controlling TCP and UDP access to internal assets. Next-Generation Firewalls operate on all the layers of the OSI model, including Layer 7.

- Traffic entering a network, e.g. through a Firewall, is called ingress traffic. Traffic leaving is called egress.

## Layer 4 Firewall

- The traditional Firewall is a Layer 4 Firewall with features such as:

  - NAT
  - Routing
  - Blocking or Allowing traffic
  - Track active network connections
  - Support VPN connections

  > **Note:** These Firewalls are typically cheaper and offers more throughput on the network than a more modern Next-Generation Firewall.
